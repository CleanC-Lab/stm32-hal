# STM32-HAL

This library provides access to STM32 peripherals that are similar across
families. It's based on the 
[STM32 Peripheral Access Crates](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs) generated by [svd2rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust)

It's designed to provide a consistent API across multiple families, with minimal code repetition.
This makes it easier to switch MCUs within, or across families, for a given project. 

Motivation: Use STM32s in real-world hardware projects. Be able to switch MCUs with
minimal code change. Prioritize getting hardware working with a reasonable feature set.
As of this library's creation, this is not feasible with the existing HAL crates due
to lack of mainainer time, and differing goals.

If using concurrently with another hal, you need to instantiate a set of
MCU peripherals for each. Ie:

```rust
let mut dp = stm32_hal::pac::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
let mut dp2 = stm32l4xx_hal::pac::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
```
