# STM32-HAL

[![Crate](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/stm32-hal2.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/stm32-hal2)
[![Docs](https://docs.rs/stm32-hal2/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/stm32-hal2)


This library provides high-level access to STM32 peripherals. It's based on the 
[STM32 Peripheral Access Crates](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs) generated by 
[svd2rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust). It provides a consistent API across 
multiple STM32 families, with minimal code repetition. This makes it easy to switch MCUs 
within, or across families, for a given project.

**Family support**: F3, F4, L4, L5, G0, G4, H7, and WB. U5 is planned once its SVD files and PAC
become available. WL eventually. (WB is WIP; not working yet!)

**Motivation**: Use STM32s in real-world hardware projects. Be able to switch MCUs with
minimal code change. 

**Design priority**: Get hardware working with a robust feature set, and a clean,
consistent API. Design around practical uses. The flexibility to choose the right MCU for each 
project, without changing code bases.

Both DMA (Direct Memory Access) and non-DMA APIs and examples are provided. DMA APIs provide faster and more efficient
operations, while non-DMA APIs are simpler, and are compatible with `embedded-hal`.

## Getting started
Review the [syntax overview example](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/tree/main/examples/syntax_overview)
for example uses of many of this library's features. Copy and paste its whole folder (It's set up
using [Knurling's app template](https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template)), or copy parts of `Cargo.toml` 
and `main.rs` as required.

### Example highlights:
```rust
use cortex_m;
use cortex_m_rt::entry;
use stm32_hal2::{
    clocks::Clocks,
    gpio::{GpioB, PinNum, PinMode, OutputType, AltFn},
    i2c::{I2c, I2cDevice},
    low_power,
    pac,
    timer::{Event::TimeOut, Timer},
};

#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    let mut cp = cortex_m::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
    let mut dp = pac::Peripherals::take().unwrap();

    let clock_cfg = Clocks::default();
    clock_cfg.setup(&mut dp.RCC, &mut dp.FLASH).unwrap();

    let mut gpiob = GpioB::new(dp.GPIOB, &mut dp.RCC);
    let mut pb15 = gpiob.new_pin(PinNum::P15, PinMode::Output);
    pb15.set_high();

    let mut timer = Timer::new_tim3(dp.TIM3, 0.2, &clock_cfg, &mut dp.RCC);
    timer.enable_interrupt(TimerInterrupt::Update);

    let mut scl = gpiob.new_pin(PinNum::P6, PinMode::Alt(AltFn::Af4));
    scl.output_type(OutputType::OpenDrain, &mut gpiob.regs);

    let mut sda = gpiob.new_pin(PinNum::P7, PinMode::Alt(AltFn::Af4));
    sda.output_type(OutputType::OpenDrain, &mut gpiob.regs);

    let i2c = I2c::new(dp.I2C1, I2cDevice::One, 100_000, &clock_cfg, &mut dp.RCC);

    loop {
        low_power::sleep_now(&mut cp.SCB);
    }
}
```

## Why this module is different from `stm32yxx-hal` libraries
There are some areas where design philosophy is different. For example: GPIO 
type-checking, level-of-abstraction from registers/PAC, role of DMA, role of `embedded-hal` traits in the API, 
feature parity among STM32 families, and clock config.

`stm32yxx-hal`s focus is building an API that doesn't let users configure something wrong. 
These guards complicate both HAL and user code, and limit functionality.
    
## Docs caveat
The Rust docs page is built for STM32L4x3, and some aspects are not accurate for other
variants. We currently don't have a good solution to this problem, and may
self-host docs in the future.

## Contributing

PRs are encouraged. Documenting each step using reference manuals is encouraged where applicable.

Most peripheral modules use the following format:

- Enums for various config settings, that implement `#[repr(u8)]` for their associated register values
- A peripheral struct that has public fields for config. This struct also includes
a private `regs` field that is the appropriate reg block. Where possible, this is defined generically
in the implementation, eg:
`U: Deref<Target = pac::usart1::RegisterBlock>`. Reference the [stm32-rs-nightlies Github](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs-nightlies)
to identify when we can take advantage of this.
- If config fields are complicated, we use a separate `PeriphConfig` struct owned by the peripheral struct.
This struct impls `Default`.
- Use raw pointers only when necessary. For example, pass `&mut dp.RCC` to methods when able.
- A constructor named `new` that performs setup code, including RCC peripheral enable and reset
- `enable_interrupt` and `clear_interrupt` functions, which accept an enum of interrupt type
- Add `embedded-hal` implementations as required, that call native methods. Note that
we design APIs based on STM32 capabilities, and apply EH traits as applicable.
- When available, base setup and usage steps on instructions provided in Reference Manuals.
These steps are copy+pasted in comments before the code that performs each one.
- Don't use PAC convenience field settings; they're implemented inconsistently across PACs.
(eg don't use something like `en.enabled()` - use `en.set_bit()`.)

        // In tracking mode, the TA flag can be monitored to make sure that the radar
        // is still tracking the target.
